# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chris, a passionate data enthusiast.

Throughout my career so far, I've been heavily involved in policy and programme delivery, mainly on programmes with a strong data and technology focus.

I've always had a knack for understanding data from a policy/operational perspective, and now Iâ€™m eager to apply my technical skills to tackle data challenges directly.
